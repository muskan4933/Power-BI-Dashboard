# Power-BI-Dashboard
 Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase the Mobile Sales Data Dashboard I created using Microsoft Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of mobile sales, including key metrics like:

âœ… Total Sales
âœ… Quantity Sold
âœ… Number of Transactions
âœ… Average Sales
âœ… Customer Ratings
âœ… Sales by City, Brand, and Mobile Model
âœ… Payment Method Analysis

The interactive visuals and detailed insights have helped me understand how data can drive smarter business decisions. ðŸ“ˆâœ¨

Iâ€™m grateful to Satish Dhawale, founder of Skill Course, whose Power BI training made this possible. His clear explanations and real-life examples helped me build this dashboard from scratch.

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:
ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling
ðŸ”¹ DAX formulas
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Visualizations
ðŸ”¹ Storytelling with Data

This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to explore more advanced features and real-world applications.
